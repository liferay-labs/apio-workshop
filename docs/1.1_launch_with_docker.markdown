# Launch with Docker

This application comes with a built-in gradle task for preparing and running a Docker image with all the necessary things pre-installed. Once you have the repository cloned in your machine, you just need to run `./gradlew runDocker` and wait till the instance is ready.

**Important**: Remember to update to the latest docker version available for your OS.

## Which are the available commands?

### `./gradlew runDocker`

This command launches the Liferay Portal instance along with a MySQL db instance.

### `./gradlew stopDocker`

This command stops and removes the Liferay Portal instance along with a MySQL db instance.

### `./gradlew dockerClean`

Removes the application jars from the Liferay Portal instance.

### `./gradlew dockerDeploy`

Deploys the application jars into the Liferay Portal instance. This command should be preceded with a call to `./gradlew dockerclean` to ensure that the module jar has been cleaned from the docker instance.
